# Module 14: Working with Lists in React 

In *Module 14: Working with Lists in React*, you’ll work through three exercises. You’ll begin by creating a To-Do list application. This will be an opportunity for you to learn how to set state in a React app and how to refactor code so you can separate the functionality into separate components. From there, you’ll learn about React Hooks, which enable you to share state logic across components. This keeps your code clean, concise, and easy to control. You’ll start using the useEffect and useState Hooks in the Rendering Lists exercises and in the Shopping Cart With Multiple Lists exercise.

## Introduction To ToDo List And CRUD

Developing a ToDo list application will allow you to work through the CRUD model Links to an external site., which you’ll encounter repeatedly as you create applications. You’ll explore these themes as your application will be able to:

- Create a new ToDo list item
- Read the list of all ToDos
- Update information, such as changing the description of a ToDo
- Delete a ToDo list item
